# Description

This game is part of my final paper, and it takes place entirely in caverns. As the player progresses, they face increasingly strong enemies and new challenges in their quest to find hidden riches.

The gameplay is based on Roguelike mechanics, with randomly generated levels, permanent death, and gradual character evolution as the player advances. It also heavily draws from the classic game Bomberman 3, featuring labyrinthine sections with destructible blocks and monsters. As the player progresses, they discover power-ups that can help them on their journey.

The player takes on the role of Ruschel, a character inspired by legendary figures from adventure films.
